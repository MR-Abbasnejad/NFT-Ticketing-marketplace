## This project was awarded 15 LINK tokens in the hackathon

Weâ€™ve got a product that will take your ticketing to the next level!!


There are Two directories in the Pass folder:
1)Final submit
2)MIdway check in


2) we have uploaded  MIdway check in for the midway check-in for the chainliank hackathon (https://github.com/MR-Abbasnejad/pass/tree/main/pass)
it's an ERC721 nft minter & marketplace which we used nextjs for the frontend and hardhat for testing the solidity code


1) Final submit is the NFT Ticketing marketplace for Chainlink hackathon we have prepared ERC 721 & ERC 1155 version for this project.(We have used Moralis infrastrucure and docs)
 You can create,buy and sell ticket of your choice using the cutting edge technology of the decade 


Also we have something like lottery powered by the Chainlink VRF that each nft adderess owner can participate in to win  (another ticket of the event, uinque NFT created by the event organizer or get some amount in crypto or...)
to use it you should deploy ERC 721 or ERC 1155 then using the contract address to deploy and start lottery


Pass is at the starting point and has many features to add and improve !!
